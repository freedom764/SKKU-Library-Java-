This is a complex Java Project that I made that uses Firebase, NetBeans, the Gradle build tool, and many different plugins. The project itself is quite a complex library management system. "Final Project Report Sample (FALL 2022).docx" has all the necessary project descriptions. 
There is also a video description available at: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/pvn685pzbiv0kai3dqa56/2022-12-11-23-12-47.mp4?rlkey=asg078z81zajjlzxrdgxgwvwb&dl=0
